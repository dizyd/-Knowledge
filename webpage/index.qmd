This page contains the supplementary material for the article *#Knowledge: Improving food-related knowledge via seeding implemented as a social media intervention* by David Izydorczyk, Barbara Kreis, Michael Kilb & Arndt Br√∂der. 

**The data** corresponding to this project can be found on the respective [OSF](https://osf.io/vztjq/). 

**The scripts** to reproduce the analysis reported in the main manuscript, the **resulting `brms`-models**, and **the stimuli used in the experiment** can be found on [Github](https://github.com/dizyd/Knowledge). 

This page was built with Quarto and thus contains also the code used to produce the analysis reported in the supplement.
