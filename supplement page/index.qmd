This page contains the supplementary material and additional information for the article *#Knowledge: Improving food-related knowledge via seeding implemented as a social media intervention* by David Izydorczyk, Barbara Kreis, Michael Kilb & Arndt Br√∂der. 

**The data**, **materials**, and the **scripts** to reproduce all analyses and figures reported in the main manuscript can be found on [Github](https://github.com/dizyd/Knowledge). 

The corresponding **`brms`-model files** from the analysis and the **preregistration** can be found on the respective [OSF](https://osf.io/vztjq/). 

This page was built with Quarto and thus contains also the code used to produce the analysis reported in the supplement.
